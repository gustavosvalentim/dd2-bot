## To Do

1. Change from UWP to Console Application and use some graphics library to take the screenshot and save to disk. Try to implement `CvInvoke.imdecode`
as using this method there is no need to save the screenshot to disk.
2. Create a separated project to opencv stuff, as this way it makes easier to change other framework stuff.
3. Use caching every time a match is found.
